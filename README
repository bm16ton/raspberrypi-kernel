The current brcmfmac driver in thiskernel uses my firmwar/nexmon patches from here  
https://github.com/bm16ton/nexmon-raspberrypi4     I also renamed the firmware file it looks 
for to brcmfmac43455-16ton-sdio so any firmware package updates dont clobber it.

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
